## Research Topic Age-Specific Mortality Patterns and Healthcare Resource Allocation
### Introduction
This project investigates how age-specific mortality patterns can inform targeted healthcare resource allocation globally, focusing particularly on ageing populations. It leverages authoritative datasets from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), OECD, and World Health Organisation (WHO) to explore the leading causes of death across different age groups. By examining suicide statistics alongside other mortality data, this research aims to enhance understanding of the demographic shifts in causes of death, providing essential insights for policymakers and healthcare providers to allocate resources and design age-sensitive healthcare interventions strategically.

### Data Source
1. CDC Suicide Data and Statistics: Offers detailed suicide statistics by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and method, aligned with FAIR and CARE principles.
2. OECD Causes of Mortality dataset: Provides extensive demographic insights into mortality causes within OECD countries.
3. WHO Suicide Data (1950-2021): Delivers a comprehensive, historical, global view of suicide trends and patterns.

### Research Question
How can age-specific mortality patterns inform targeted healthcare resource allocation for ageing populations worldwide?

### Processing & Visualization

#### Current Progress

Data Integration: Combined CDC, OECD, and WHO datasets to comprehensively analyze mortality trends.

Interactive Visualization: Developed a dynamic dashboard using Plotly to enhance data exploration, usability, and engagement.

#### Key Features
