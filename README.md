# Infosci301 Final Project: Age-Specific Mortality Patterns and Healthcare Resource Allocation

## 📌 Research Topic

**Age-Specific Mortality Patterns and Healthcare Resource Allocation**

## 🧭 Introduction

This project investigates how **age-specific mortality patterns** can inform **targeted healthcare resource allocation** globally, with a special focus on ageing populations. 

Using authoritative datasets from the **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)**, **OECD**, and the **World Health Organization (WHO)**, the project explores the **leading causes of death across age groups**, including in-depth analysis of suicide statistics. By understanding demographic shifts in mortality patterns, we aim to provide actionable insights for **policymakers** and **healthcare providers** to design **age-sensitive interventions** and **optimize healthcare resources**.

## ❓ Research Question

**How can age-specific mortality patterns inform targeted healthcare resource allocation for ageing populations worldwide?**

## 📊 Data Sources

1. **CDC Suicide Data and Statistics**  
   - Provides suicide data disaggregated by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and method.  
   - Aligned with **FAIR** and **CARE** data principles.

2. **OECD Causes of Mortality Dataset**  
   - Offers broad demographic insights into causes of death in OECD countries.

3. **WHO Suicide Data (1950–2021)**  
   - Presents a comprehensive global and historical perspective on suicide trends.
