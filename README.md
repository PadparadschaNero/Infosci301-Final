# Infosci301 Final Project: Visualizing Global Suicide Trends: A Data-Driven Exploration of Patterns Across Time, Gender, and Geography

## 📌 Research Topic

**Age-Specific Mortality Patterns and Healthcare Resource Allocation**

## 🧭 Introduction

This project investigates how **age-specific mortality patterns** can inform **targeted healthcare resource allocation** globally, with a special focus on ageing populations. 

Using authoritative datasets from the **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)**, **OECD**, and the **World Health Organization (WHO)**, the project explores the **leading causes of death across age groups**, including in-depth analysis of suicide statistics. By understanding demographic shifts in mortality patterns, we aim to provide actionable insights for **policymakers** and **healthcare providers** to design **age-sensitive interventions** and **optimize healthcare resources**.

## ❓ Research Question

**How can age-specific mortality patterns inform targeted healthcare resource allocation for ageing populations worldwide?**

## 📊 Data Sources

1. **CDC Suicide Data and Statistics**  
   - Provides suicide data disaggregated by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and method.  
   - Aligned with **FAIR** and **CARE** data principles.

2. **OECD Causes of Mortality Dataset**  
   - Offers broad demographic insights into causes of death in OECD countries.

3. **WHO Suicide Data (1950–2021)**  
   - Presents a comprehensive global and historical perspective on suicide trends.

## 📊 SDG Goals

This project aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3: "Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages." By offering clear, accessible visualizations of suicide trends, it enables policymakers, mental health practitioners, and the public to identify at-risk populations and evaluate progress toward suicide prevention. The project emphasizes the importance of mental health data transparency and cross-national comparisons, contributing to early warning systems and more effective policy responses aimed at reducing suicide rates globally.

### 🔜 Next Steps

- Expand visualizations to offer **deeper insights** and greater interactivity.
- Enhance visual appeal and usability by refining **color schemes**, **responsive layouts**, and **interface accessibility**.

##  Reflection on Growth and Learning
Moving from the individual InfoVis Redesign to our team-based project marked a significant step in my intellectual and professional growth. The solo project helped us develop foundational design skills and understand the importance of audience-centered visualization. Working in a team later pushed me to communicate ideas clearly, adapt to feedback, and collaborate effectively.

In-class activities deepened our technical abilities and design thinking, while symposiums exposed me to real-world applications of data visualization, showing how visuals can drive social awareness. Most notably, the ZhouZhuang Life Mysterious Museum field trip reshaped our team’s design approach. Seeing how the museum used storytelling and local culture to engage audiences inspired us to create visualizations that are context-sensitive and socially meaningful.


## 👥 Team Contribution

- **Qianyue Jiao**: Led data collection and preprocessing, ensuring compliance with international standards (FAIR and CARE).
- **Yifei Yang**: Conducted exploratory data analysis and contributed to insight generation and interpretability.
- **Zixuan Li**: Designed the interactive dashboard and developed the innovation flowchart using user-centered design principles.
